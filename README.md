# Bus-Simulation
This project involves the simulation of a bus simulation using OpenGL. The simulation provides a realistic environment where buses arrive, passengers board and alight, and the bus stop operates efficiently. Through interactive visuals and accurate timing, the project aims to replicate a real-world bus simulation experience for users.
